This project aims to assess the relationship between mental health and employment, social deprivation, social capital, and health in Scotland. The data was derived from the Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) 2020, and access to the dataset was kindly provided by the UK data Service (https://ukdataservice.ac.uk).  

In order to run the Jupyter Notebook, ensure that the file is run from the same folder as the data.csv and Indian_States.shp files.

The .Shp is necessary to generate the choropleth.
