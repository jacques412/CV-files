This project explores Indian suicide rates and related factors from 2001 to 2012. The data set is population data that focuses on the profiles of suicide victims and accidental deaths in India from 2001 to 2012. The source of the data is the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), an Indian government agency responsible for collecting and analysing crime data. 

In order to run the Jupyter Notebook, ensure that the file is run from the same folder as the data.csv and Indian_States.shp files.

The .Shp is necessary to generate the choropleth.
